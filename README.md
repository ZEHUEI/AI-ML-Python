## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository contains multiple assignments and projects completed in Python (and Jupyter Notebooks) for AI/ML practice.  
The current major focus is a **Personal Handwriting Recognizer** that uses a CSV dataset of ~1,186 handwriting samples. You’ll find scripts, notebooks, and reports designed to build, train and evaluate a machine learning model on these data.

## 🛠 Key Features

- ✅ Python code (using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- ✅ Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and modelling  
- ✅ Handwriting-recognition dataset of ~1,186 samples  
- ✅ Training and evaluation pipeline (data preprocessing, feature extraction, modelling)  
- 🧪 Assignment-style projects: multiple experiments in modular folders  
- 📊 Report folder with graphs / findings (planned/implemented)  
- 🧩 Easy to extend: you can add new datasets, try deep-learning models, or build a UI
